# Week 1 Challenge

## Description
My Motivation?: I want to learn and practice so that I may develop my bsic HTML and CSS skills.
Why did I build this project: I built this project as a tool to exlpore basic HTML and CSS code and how they interact together. This project also explores the idea of Web Accessibility, and how we can create websites to be more inclusive of everyone.
What problem does this solve?: This project solves Horiseon's website accessibility problem by altering the website's code adding in Semantic HTML elements and alternate imagery descriptions on top of many other things.
What did I learn?: I learned how different semantic HTML elements, such as nav, section or aside, can be used to alter how a website looks and it's code functions.
